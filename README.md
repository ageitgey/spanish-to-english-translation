# Training a Spanish-to-English model with Marian

This is an example of building a Spansh-to-English sequence-to-sequence
neural translation model using Marian.

This code is based on the `training-basics` example included with Marian
which is in turn adapted from the Romanian-English
sample at https://github.com/rsennrich/wmt16-scripts. 

This is a great place to start if you want to play around with building
your own Google-Translate-style language translation model.
